Join us for our 28th Annual University of Waterloo Juggling Festival! We'll have workshops, games, a silent auction, and an _incredible_ gala [show]({{site.baseurl}}{% link show.md%})! You'll want to be there.

From beginners with no experience to advanced prop manipulators, there will be workshops and fun for everybody! 

The festival (workshops & vendors) is all in the Student Life Center. (Except for Friday evening, when we will be in the [PAC](https://goo.gl/maps/eQWgCLZ1NXTjcr6AA){:target="_blank"} Small Gym.)

The X lot (above Columbia street) has free parking starting on Friday from 4:30 pm until Monday at 6:00 am (although cars should not be left overnight.) It's about 7 minutes to walk from there to the SLC. To save on walking, you could also park in the M lot for $6/day. That's around 3-4 minutes from the SLC.

The E lot is also free after 6:00 pm on Friday, but it's a bit farther away.

If you're looking for a place to stay, we'll be organizing housing closer to the festival.
