Join us for our 28th Annual University of Waterloo Juggling Festival! We'll have workshops, games, a silent auction, and an _incredible_ gala show! You'll want to be there.

The festival (workshops & vendors) is all in the Student Life Center. (Except for Friday evening, when we will be in the PAC Small Gym.) 

From beginners with no experience to advanced prop manipulators, there will be workshops and fun for everybody! 

Directions: [Campus Map](https://uwaterloo.ca/map/), [Parking Map](https://uwaterloo.ca/map/pdf/map_colour.pdf).

The X lot (above Columbia street) has free parking starting on Friday from 4:30 pm until Monday at 6:00 am (although cars should not be left overnight.) It's about 7 minutes to walk from there to the SLC. To save on walking, you could also park in the M lot for $6/day. That's around 3-4 minutes from the SLC.

The E lot is also free after 6:00 pm on Friday, but it's a bit farther away.

If you're looking for a place to stay, we'll be organizing housing closer to the festival.
