Our incredible Gala Show will be at 7:30pm on Saturday night, with doors opening at 7:00.

Tickets will be $15 for adults and $7 for children 12 and under!

Tickets, or a package including a show ticket and a festival shirt, will be available at the festival and the door (as long as shirt supplies last). 

Alternatively, show tickets will be available online closer to the show date.

The show will be in the Humanities Theater, in Hagey Hall, on the University of Waterloo campus.
