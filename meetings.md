The club meets Wednesdays from 4:00-6:00pm, generally at the Physical Activities Complex in Activity Area North, on the University of Waterloo campus. However, it's best to check the [Facebook Group](www.facebook.com/groups.uwjuggling) or send us an email at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}), as we could be outside if it's nice out, or in a different location due to exams.
